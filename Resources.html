                or resources we have written:

                <li><a href="./img/Mental Resilience Training a review better version.docx">Mental Resilience
                        Training review</a> <br>
                    This is a 12000 word review that was written by us to get a better understanding of MRT in the
                    RAPTC, we read more than 100 papers. You will be able to find a reference list at the end of this
                    review if you're interested in reading more papers. It is a comprehensive review looking at MRT
                    within elite sport and military contexts and finally putting it togther to look at Mental Resilience
                    Training and Psychological Skills Training in the RAPTC. It's a long read and most of it has been
                    summarised in this website so this is not a necessary read but it will give you more of in depth
                    grasp of MRT.

                    These crib cards were created as a way to remember what each pillar of MRT is and what they look
                    like in a session. This powerpoint version will allow you to reword or change some things to make
                    it easier to use for you.

                    We are carrying out an audit in order to understand which pillars are already being used during
                    training sessions and which ones aren't. This will not only allow us to prove that MRT is already
                    being used in PT sessions but also to identify the training gap and which pillars should be taught
                    in more depth in order to be implemented into training sessions. <br>
                    This form is available on any device and it would be great if PTIs could fill them during their
                    sessions. If you have any questions about it please send us an email.

                    We have a working group in place with both military personel and experts in psychology in order to
                    understand MRT better, share our ideas, knowledge and experiences. This working group meets every
                    two weeks on Tuesdays through zoom. If you would like to be invovled because MRT is of particular
                    interest to you, please send us an email.

                    Dennis Corbet and Colin Gomez experienced an avalanche accident in late January in the French Alps.
                    Dennis was riding a cool face when, after a drop, a slab got triggered. He didn’t really understand
                    what was happening and fell while turning on the crack. He was immediately covered by the avalanche
                    and got pushed to the bottom.
