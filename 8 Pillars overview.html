            <h2>Overview of the 8 pillars</h2>
            <p>
                From the <a href="./img/Mental Resilience Training a review better version.docx">research</a> we have
                carried out on MRT within <span style="font-weight: bold;">elite sport</span> and the <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">military context</span>, we found <span
                    style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">8 pillars</span> to be relevant to
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">MRT within the RAPTC</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Resilience needs to be implemented into the training at both levels so both <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">AAPTIs</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">RAPTCIs</span> can
                <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">themselves be resilient</span> and be able to <span
                    style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">teach resilience</span>. This should be integrated into the
                training in
                order to <span style="font-weight: bold;">minimise the amount of change</span>. The outcome goal of MRT
                in the corps is
                that instructors are aware of their own levels of resilience, know how to improve and train their MR,
                but
                are also knowledgeable and can teach different techniques to increase their units' MR.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">8 pillars of MRT within the RAPTC</span> and the
                instructors control them for their units but also
                for
                themselves.
                It is important to remember that an <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">individual can be
                    resilient without all 8 pillars</span>, but <span style="font-weight: bold;">the more pillars they
                    have, the more resilient they are</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">8 pillars</span> necessary to be resilient in
                the corps:

                <h2>Social Support & Unit Cohesion</h2>
                <p>Social support is the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">perceived social support
                        (PSS)</span> of the people around the soldiers they can <span style="font-weight: bold;">rely

                    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">vent to</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Social support is not only from friends and family, but also, the chain of command and unit.
                    Soldiers with higher levels of PSS will <span style="font-weight: bold;">perform better</span>. Unit
                    cohesion for AAPTIs and RAPTCIs either
                    describes
                    the cohesion of the soldiers within the ASPT or within the units they are posted to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Social support as a whole is seen as <span style="font-weight: bold;">stress-buffering</span> and
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">performance enhancing</span> for the soldiers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cohesion in this sense, is defined as the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">group
                        integration and personal bonding</span> among members of the
                    unit.

                <h2>Emotional Control</h2>
                <p>
                    Emotional control is the way an individual <span style="font-weight: bold;">regulates their
                        emotions</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">generate positive

                <p>
                    AAPTIs and RAPTCIs go through a lot of difficult training and testing such as the SCR and RFTS. It
                    is
                    important that when they can’t get feedback, individuals are able to control their <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">emotions</span> and
                    foster

                </p>
                <p>
                    Soldiers need to be able to <span style="font-weight: bold;">move on</span> from negative

                <h2>Mindset Control</h2>
                <p>
                    Mindset control in a PTI context is the ability to <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">
                        focus mindfully on one task at a time</span> and see
                    adversity as a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">challenge and not a threat</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ability to <span style="font-weight: bold;">not get distracted</span> by the noise and people
                    around them is an essential skill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mindset control also involves getting <span style="font-weight: bold;">out of their “comfort
                        zones”</span> and into a learning and growth
                    zone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <span style="font-weight: bold;">recognition and positive interpretation</span> of <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">pain/discomfort sensations</span> are crucial to
                    performance. A
                    member of the armed forces should be able to put their body through an immense amount of fatigue and
                    physical/mental pain/discomfort <span style="font-weight: bold;">without succumbing to it</span>.

                <h2>Purpose & Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    It is essential for soldiers coming into the RAPTC to have a <span
                        style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"> strong sense of purpose</span> and be
                    <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">motivated</span>.
                    They are <span style="font-weight: bold;">important determinants of performance</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, they must <span style="font-weight: bold;">understand why</span> they are training the way they
                    are and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">benefits</span> of the training
                    they
                    are giving/being given. The more they <span style="font-weight: bold;">understand and agree with
                        it</span>, the more they will be motivated
                    to
                    do it well. This is especially important when they are going through a week such as selection week
                    where
                    a lot of <span style="font-weight: bold;">mental and physical pressure</span> is put on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another incidence when motivation and purpose are essential is when a soldier who is overweight or
                    coming back from injury, the instructors must manage to <span style="font-weight: bold;">help this
                        individual find a purpose</span> and get
                    back
                    into regular PT.

                    During PT, <span style="font-weight: bold;">good relationships</span> are important to ensure
                    everyone is supported, equally appropriate
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">levels of challenge</span> are also important in order to <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">maintain motivation</span> and <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">desired outcomes</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RAPTCIs must create a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"> psychologically safe
                        environment</span> in which <span style="font-weight: bold;">sensible risk-taking</span> is
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">encouraged</span>.
                    Soldiers need to <span style="font-weight: bold;">learn from their mistakes</span> in order to <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">improve and perform at higher standards</span>. PTIs
                    must also recognise and celebrate any successes.
                </p>
                <p>

                    In this environment, individuals become <span style="font-weight: bold;">more resilient</span> and
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">perform better</span>, as long as there is the
                    appropriate balance between support and challenge.

                <p>
                    Self-belief and self-confidence is the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"> degree of
                        certainty an individual possesses about their
                        ability
                        to be successful</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important for PT instructors to be confident in their <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">knowledge and ability to teach</span>. They
                    need to
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">believe in themselves</span> in order to inspire confidence in
                    their students. While on PT, the soldiers
                    also
                    need to <span style="font-weight: bold;">believe in their capability</span> to successfully go
                    through the different tests. Self-belief and
                    confidence have been shown to have a <span style="font-weight: bold;">positive impact on
                        performance</span> and to be an important
                    determinant

                <p>
                    Soldiers must develop <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"> diverse types of coping
                        strategies</span> (ways to deal effectively with stress) to
                    be

                        strategies</span> to their students. To build effective
                    coping strategies, instructors and their recruits need to be put in a <span

                    to
                    ensure they have enough exposure to high pressure situations. This will allow them to <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">develop, adapt and grow</span> in the face of adversity. Coping
                    strategies are necessary to get through tough times or tough
