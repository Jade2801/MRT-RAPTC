            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Psychological skills training (PST) is the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">“systematic and
                    consistent practice of mental or
                    psychological skills for the purpose of enhancing performance, increasing enjoyment, or achieving
                    greater sport or physical satisfaction”</span>. PST tends to be
                neglected because of myths built around it such as: it is from problem individuals only, elite athletes
                only, quick fix solution and it isn’t useful. PST helps <span
                    style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">increase all eight pillars of MRT</span>. Multiple
                studies have found that PST has a<span style="font-weight: bold;">positive effect on performance</span>.
                There are four steps to the
                implementation of a
                PST program: <span style="font-weight: bold;">education phase</span>, <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">acquisition phase</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">practice
                    phase</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-regulation phase</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The US Olympic committee gave top 10 principles for PST (these are relavant fro the RAPTC):
            <ol>
                <li>Mental training <span style="font-weight: bold;">can’t replace</span> physical training</li>
                <li>Physical training and physical ability <span style="font-weight: bold;">alone</span> are <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">not enough</span> to succeed consistently at elite levels
                </li>
                <li>A strong mind may not win an Olympic medal but a <span style="font-weight: bold;">weak one will
                        lose</span> it</li>
                <li>Coaches/Instructors will not frequently know what their athletes are thinking</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Thoughts affect behaviour</span>, therefore consistent thoughts
                    will result in consistent behaviour</li>
                <li>Coaches have a different view of changing technical mistakes vs mental mistakes</li>
                <li>Coaches must be <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">involved</span> in the psychological/
                    mental training</li>
                <li>There is a need to force athletes to put time and effort into mental training</li>
                <li>Mental skills should be measured in order to maximise performance</li>
                <li>Coaches need to think about <span style="font-weight: bold;">their own mental skills</span> </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                A randomised control study found that between a control group of soldiers receiving no mental training
                and a group of soldiers receiving psychological skills training, the latter reported a <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">greater use of
                    cognitive skills</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">increased self-belief</span> and <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">performed significantly better</span> on a range of different
                military task including the fitness related tasks
            </p>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Motivation is the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">ability to initiate and persist at a
                    task</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Positive motivation can be attained through the satisfaction of three psychological needs:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Autonomy</span>: feeling empowered and having a choice.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Competence</span>: Feeling capable and effective.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Competence</span>: Feeling valued by- and close to- others.

            <h2>Arousal Regulation</h2>
            <p>
                Arousal is a <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">“state of physiological and psychological
                    activation that varies on a continuum from deep
                    sleep to intense excitement”</span>. Anxiety is a “negative emotional state characterised by
                feelings of
                nervousness and worry associated with activation or arousal of the body (e.g.: becoming nervous from
                increased heart rate)”.
                Arousal influences performance, it can increase muscle tension and coordination difficulties, it can
                also impact attention and concentration.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many arousal regulation techniques, there are two types: <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">techniques to reduce arousal</span> and
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">techniques to increase arousal</span>. This is an arousal reducing
                technique:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Breathing techniques</span>: it is one of the easiest and most
                    effective ways to control anxiety and muscle
                    tension. Observing someone’s breathing gives information on their state of arousal. If someone is
                    calm, confident and in control their breathing will be smooth, deep and rhythmical. When someone is
                    under pressure and tense, their breathing will be short, shallow, and irregular.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                However, not all physical and mental tension is negative and not all of it should be eliminated. Small
                amounts of tension are desirable when a state of alertness and attentiveness is required. These are a
                few
                signs of under-arousal: moving slowly, easily distracted, lack of concern about performance, lack of
                enthusiasm and anticipation and heavy legs. The following techniques are used to enhance/induce arousal:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Increase breathing rate</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Act energised</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Listen to music</span></li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <div class="container" id="section-4">
            <h2>Self-efficacy</h2>
            <p>
                Self-efficacy also known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">self-confidence</span> is <span
                    style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">the degree of certainty one possesses about their ability
                    to be successful</span>. There are multiple positive effects of self-confidence: it <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">arouses positive
                    emotions</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">facilitates concentration</span>, <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">positively
                    affects goals</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">increases effort</span>, <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">positively affects psychological momentum</span>
                . If an individual lacks necessary skill, has insufficient motivation, or the task
                is ambiguous, then self-efficacy will not lead to desired performance. However, if someone has the
                skills and motivation, then <span style="font-weight: bold;"> self-efficacy is a robust predictor of
                    performance</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Self-confidence is influenced by the following:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Performance accomplishments</span> "<span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">I have done it before so I can do it
                        again</span>" <br>
                    Past performance accomplishments have the most impact on one's self-confidence when an individual
                    successfully completes a difficult task without external assistance or experiences rare failure.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Vicarious experiences</span>: "<span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">If she can do it, I can do it</span>" <br>
                    It is important to watch others perform the task or skill that one is trying to learn. This will
                    work if the skills and attributes fo the performers are very similar.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Persuasion</span>: "<span style="font-weight: bold;">I
                        know you are a good athlete</span>" <br>
                    Techniques for persuasion include verbal persuasion, evaluative feedback, expectations from others
                    and self-talk. Persuasion needs to be used with other techniques; it is harder to instil strong
                    self-efficacy beliefs with only persuasion techniques.
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Physiological states</span>: "<span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">My fast heart-beat signifies
                        excitement</span>"<br>
                    The individual’s perception of their own physiological state has an important impact on their
                    self-efficacy.
                </li>

                    <p>
                        There are <span style="font-weight: bold;">3 types of goals</span>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outcome goals</span> focus on a result and should
                            facilitate short-term motivation BUT can increase
                            anxiety and distracting thoughts e.g., "I want to get into the RAPTC; therefore, I have to
                            pass the selection course and be one of the best".
                        </li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance goals</span> focus on achieving standards or
                            performance objectives without considering
                            competitiors e.g., "I need to pass the RFTS to stay on the course".
                        </li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Process goals</span> focus on the actions needed to perform
                            well e.g., "I need to have good
                            technique while doing the deadlift to do it successfully".
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Process and performance goals can make more precise adjustments to goals and depend less on
                    others' behaviours.

                        to <span style="font-weight: bold;">higher levels of performance</span> than vague goals. <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Short term goals</span> are <span
                            style="font-weight: bold;">more effective</span> than long term goals: they offer more
                        opportunities to

                            To improve concentration skills, it is important for individual to learn how to “park” their
                            intruding thoughts, learn to maintain focus, rehearse concentration in high-pressured
                            environments and learn to shift their attention.

                                    relaxation is used to relieve muscle tension. Decreased muscle tension will lead to

                                        with poor performance. However, negative self-talk can have positive impacts on
                                        performance when used appropriately (i.e., it can be interpreted as
                                        motivational, e.g., “a talking to” following a mistake). <br>
